# Lu, Bing-Ze's Segmentation

## Demo
Here is the demo of single-level of Lu, Bing-Ze's segmentation method

This result is apply the initial called "Checkerboard"
$$
\begin{equation}
    \phi_0(x,y) = \frac{\pi}{10} \left(\sin{x}+\cos{y} \right)
\end{equation}
$$

and the parameters relative to force terms are
$$
    \lambda_1 = 1, \\
    \lambda_2 = 1.
$$
the parameter relative to zero level set is 
$$
    \mu = 10^{-3}
$$
